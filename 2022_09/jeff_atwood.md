exception driven devloperment ... this is the iceberg of coding horrors,
https://blog.codinghorror.com/exception-driven-development/

If you're waiting around for users to tell you about problems with your website or application, you're only seeing a tiny fraction of all the problems that are actually occurring. The proverbial tip of the iceberg.

Also, if this is the case, I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but you kind of suck at your job -- which is to know more about your application's health than your users do. When a user informs me about a bona fide error they've experienced with my software, I am deeply embarrassed. And more than a little ashamed. I have failed to see and address the issue before they got around to telling me. I have neglected to crash responsibly.
