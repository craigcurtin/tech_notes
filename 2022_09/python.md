found some good python tutorials at datacamp, got from LRyan beginner to intermediate


i did some digging, i'm not sure Datacamp is good at 'teaching' it is good at providing solutions
rather than teaching the why/how .... here is the solution


saw this many years ago, thought they did good stuff https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/

seems everyone wants to hook you on their bootcamp these days ... ugh
