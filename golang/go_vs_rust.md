Can you give some perspective on how Rust and Go compares languages?

LS: Okay. So Go is more designed for concurrent programming. We know that
almost every computer, they have multi-core CPU. So concurrent programming is became
more and more important. And the goal is designed for that purpose. 
Another feature for Go is that Go is really friendly to new language, to new guys, 
I mean in terms of learning Go. So it is
very friendly to those new programmers. I think this is another reason why Go became very
popular. 

And many people, they write a lot of blogs saying that Go has a potential to dominate
the server-side application.

And I think probably Go has the potential to replace JavaScript. 

This is my personal opinion.
For Rust, Rust is designed to eliminate also the memory and the concurrency bug in C
