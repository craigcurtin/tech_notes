#Attending lectures
in person, is mandatory.   

All lectures and recitations are recorded for offline review or asynchronous streaming in situations where synchronous participation wasn't feasible, but you still are expected to attend the actual lecture in person unless: 

1. you were sick and have a medical letter telling us to excuse you from class; 
1. PSCC asked students to attend remotely due a Covid spike; 
1. you are using up one of your 3 permitted "didn't attend" days.  Sick but no letter?  Then it counts towards one of these 3 days.  

If you plan to interview, please keep in mind that PSCC  doesn't excuse you from class to interview.  Interviews count against the 3 days, too.

We do not take attendance, but we do want to emphasize that in-person attendance has far better learning outcomes than watching videos.  Use the videos if you have to miss a class, or to review material -- not as your primary learning tool.  People who try to learn purely from videos invariably perform badly on exams and are not really comfortable with the course content by the end of the semester when asked about basic ideas in connection to their project designs.  So don't try to work from home -- it just isn't a good strategy!  
In general we assume that most students will end up missing no more than 3 in-person lectures.
