# How to Have a Bad Career | David Patterson | Talks at Google


Renowned computer scientist David Patterson came to Mountain View to provide advice that, 
as he puts it, "I wish I had been given at the start of my career."

An entertaining and engaging presenter, 
Prof. Patterson takes us through a number of tongue-in-cheek examples of how to sink a career in 
academics and elsewhere. 
He also provides great tips on how how to steer clear of these mistakes and build a career that is both successful and satisfying.

David Patterson wrote the book Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach with 
John Hennessy and helped lead UC Berkeley research projects Reduced Instruction Set Computers (RISC), 
Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID), 
and Network of Workstations (NOW). 
He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering, 
the National Academy of Sciences, the Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame, 
both AAAS organizations, and President of ACM.
